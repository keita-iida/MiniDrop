# MiniDrop

**MiniDrop** is a compact, easy-to-follow collection of code and explanations for droplet-based experiments, algorithms, and implementation methods.  
The two main learning resources are the **Prior Knowledge** page and the **Hands-on Tutorial**, both hosted on GitHub Pages.

---

## Prior Knowledge (recommended)

Start here to understand the essential concepts before running any examples.

👉 **[Prior Knowledge — Droplet basics and concepts](https://keita-iida.github.io/MiniDrop/docs/priorknowledge_001.html)**

This document introduces:
- What droplets are  
- Fundamental droplet operations  
- The underlying model used in MiniDrop  
- Basic design considerations  

Reading this first will greatly help when following the tutorial.

## Tutorial (hands-on)

After reviewing the prior knowledge, move on to the guided tutorial.

👉 **[MiniDrop Tutorial — step-by-step guide](https://keita-iida.github.io/MiniDrop/docs/tutorial_minidrop.html)**

The tutorial covers:
- Environment setup  
- Project structure  
- Example scripts (droplet generation, manipulation, etc.)  
- How to reproduce results and extend examples
